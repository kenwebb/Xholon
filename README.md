Xholon
------

Xholon is a tool for working on whatever I'm interested in,
and I hope that other people will also find it useful.
The focus is on hierarchical structure, building complex worlds,
open-ended dynamic interactions, visualization,
and letting people paste in new content while an application is running.

Xholon uses Google Web Toolkit (GWT) to compile it's Java source code into a 100% JavaScript library.
The JavaScript API (http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/gwt/jsapidoc/)
enables writing web applications that run entirely in the browser.

Some of the numerous sample apps at http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/gwt/ 
were written in Java, and some exist as XML and JavaScript Xholon Workbooks
available as individual gist files at https://gist.github.com/kenwebb .
All of these apps run entirely in the browser with no ongoing need for a server.
