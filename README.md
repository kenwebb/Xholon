Xholon
------

Xholon is a tool for working on whatever I'm interested in,
and I hope that other people will also find it useful.
The focus is on hierarchical structure, building complex worlds,
open-ended dynamic interactions, visualization,
and letting people paste in new content while the application is running.

There are numerous sample apps at:
