Xholon
------

Xholon is an open-source library for making open-ended HTML5 client-side applications.
The technology focus is on hierarchical and graph structure, building complex worlds,
dynamic interactions, visualization, dynamic content updates, ...

Xholon uses [Google Web Toolkit] [6] (GWT 2.5.1) to compile this repository's Java source code
(documented [here] [7]) into a 100%-JavaScript library.
The [JavaScript API] [1] (with a [jQuery] [13]-like syntax) enables writing web applications
that run entirely in the browser.

Some of the numerous [sample apps] [2] were written in Java,
and some exist as XML and JavaScript Xholon Workbooks available as individual [gist files] [3].
All of these apps run entirely in the browser with no ongoing need for a server.

Xholon is an online environment for exploring and playing around with things
as diverse as the structure of a biological cell and the movements of characters
in Lord of the Rings. Start by jotting down a few notes, progress to
working out what the domain objects are and how they interact,
and make it rock by writing some code.

It's all based on the idea that everything is connected. This makes Xholon
difficult to describe, because there are so many ways that things can be connected.
The best way to start learning is with the sample apps.

### [Hello World] [4] sample app
View the source code and run it, and then make a small edit in the source code and run it again.

### [Lord of the Rings] [5] sample app
View the source code and run it, and then make a small edit in the source code and run it again.
