See notes in my notebook from Jan 13 2011.
The following 2 files are from a third-party:
  client.html (DO NOT run this from Eclipse; it will crash Eclipse)
  HelloScript.java.txt

The .js scripts will work in a modified version of Bestiary:

Paste a .js script into the Bestiary console, and press Submit.
