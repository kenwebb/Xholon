This is a checklist of things TODO before uploading an SVG file to wikipedia.
The checklist is in the order that the tasks should be performed.

General
* Look at the wikipedia pages I've printed out for details.
* See my green notebook, around Sept 18, 2011.
* If possible, upload to commons rather than en.wikipedia .

Inkscape
* Don't use Inkscape flowed text.
* Don't use special effects like blurring.
* Don't use arrowheads/dashed lines.
* Vaccuum or remove unused defs.
* Save file as Inkscape "Optimized SVG", using Indent:Space only. (includes Scour)

Final polishing in a text editor
* Use Scour to tidy up/create a smaller file. (optional)
* Delete any references to external files.
* Add to text style (otherwise SVG Salamander shows text as extra bold):
  font-weight:normal;
* Change all text to style (Inkscape can't handle this):
  font-family:'Liberation Sans',Arial,sans-serif
  NO! use font-family:Arial instead

Validation
* SVG Validator (http://validator.w3.org/)
* SVG Check (direct link) http://toolserver.org/%7Ejarry/svgcheck/stable
  I get lots of warnings about the font.

Uploading
* See Commons:First steps/Upload form
* Fill out the {{information}} box.

After uploading
* Tag uploaded file as {{Created with Inkscape}} or {{Inkscape-hand}}
* Tag the original raster image with {{vector version available}}
* If your file has passed the SVG Validator, you can put the {{validSVG}} tag on the image page.
* Categorize the SVG under Category:SVG
* Scale the image. (optional)
