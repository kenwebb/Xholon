I downloaded box2d from: https://github.com/hecht-software/box2dweb
Box2D.js
Box2d.min.js
demo.html
example.html

I've also saved physics.js from:
https://probmods.org/chapters/conditioning.html
It provides the API used with some webppl examples.
  physics.animate
Note that physics.js uses jQuery $ .
  I converted the jQuery code to JavaScript vanilla code.

I am also trying the version of box2d at:
https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js
The JS file is:
planck-with-testbed.js
