Island Game - Experiment
email from Jen: "thoughts on what it means to use some object/some person" Sept 27, 2019
########################################################################################
Suppose I have a sequence of actions that results in a particular outcome.

Now imagine that I, myself purely with my own body and nothing else, have carried out this sequence of actions - we'll imagine this even if some of the actions are outside my current capabilities.

To use something (or someone) means that I substitute that thing (or person) for myself in that sequence of actions.

There may need to be some additional actions added to the sequence to enable the use of the other thing, but the main point is that I can substitute the thing for myself, essentially

Example 1:

My goal - to see Big Ben, in London, with my own eyes.

I get up
I fly to London
I travel to Big Ben
I look at Big Ben

I get up
I fly to London USING AN AIRPLANE
I travel to Big Ben USING A TAXI
I look at Big Ben

Example 2:

My goal - to eat some fruit

I knock the fruit out of the very tall tree
I pick the fruit up
I eat the fruit

I knock the fruit out of the very tall tree USING A ROCK
I pick the fruit up
I eat the fruit

Result of initial experiment:

I myself: who
 You are I myself:avatar_11228.
I myself: where
 You are in Ottawa:city_11227.
I myself: look
 You are in Ottawa:city_11227.
 You see airplane_11231
I myself: inventory
 You are carrying:
 my own:body_11229
 my own:eyes_11230
I myself: [I get up]
I myself: [I fly to London]
I myself: next London
 Moving to London:city_11232
I myself: [I travel to Big Ben]
I myself: enter "Big Ben"
 Entered Big Ben:building_11233
I myself: [I look at Big Ben]
I myself: look
 You are in Big Ben:building_11233.
