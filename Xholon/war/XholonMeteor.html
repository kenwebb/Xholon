    <h3>Xholon with Meteor</h3>
    <p>Xholon can use <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>, a popular platform for developing JavaScript apps. Meteor offers many features. Initially, Xholon uses Meteor's ability to easily and efficiently distribute data from one computer to one or more other computers. If you and one or more other people are running the same Xholon app, then whatever nodes you add to the app will almost instantly appear to all the other users. For example, in an elementary school classroom, where each of 20 grade 3/4 students had his or her own Chromebook laptop, I was able to demonstrate what I wanted them to do by typing simple commands into my own computer.</p>
    <p>For this to work, you must be either running a local Meteor server, or using the release of Xholon hosted at <a href="https://www.meteor.com/hosting">Meteor Galaxy</a>.</p>

Right-click on the garage, and select Edit > Paste Last Child. You will immediately see a bicycle and scooter inside the garage, as will anyone else using this app. You'll probably first want to zoom in (click on the + sign) a few times so you can see the house and garage.</p>-->
