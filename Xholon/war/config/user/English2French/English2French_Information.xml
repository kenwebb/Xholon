<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This book is for anyone learning French without benefit of a teacher.
You may be planning a trip to a French-speaking country,
or you may have some non-travel end in mind.
Depending on your goal, you can use this as either a "How-To",
or a "Teach-Yourself" book. More likely you'll combine the two approaches.</p>
<p>In a "How-To" book the end result is all important.</p>
<p>In a "Teach-Yourself" book the end may still be very important,
but so are the means to that end.</p>

<title>Introduction to the TRANSLATOR</title>
<p>The TRANSLATOR is the heart of this book.
It combines all of the following into one integrated package:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Phrase Book.
The TRANSLATOR gives even the complete beginner the power to say or write
just about any common phrase in French. The translator will automatically
translate English sentences into French, provided the sentence:
(1) includes only the words contained in the WORD_LIST (this limitation can
be overcome by buying a dictionary, and following the DICTIONARY_INTERFACE
rules on page .), and
(2) is not exceptionally long and involved. Try to keep your sentences below ten words.
This book also includes as examples many already translated phrases.
</li>
<li>A Beginner's English to French Dictionary</li>
<li>A Basic Grammar</li>
</ul>

<title>How to Translate a Sentence</title>
<p>In translating a sentence you will go through several steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down an English sentence that you wish to translate.</li>
<li>If your sentence is a question, go through the NORMALIZE procedure.</li>
<li>
Look up each word, or word sequence, of the sentence, in the WORD_LIST.
The introduction to the WORD_PASS section tells you how to interpret
the instructions found with each English word.
</li>
<li>
Look up each "flag", generated in step #3, in the FLAG_LIST.
Flags look like "A-FPL-A" "C-PLU-A" etc. They let you know exactly
how to change the word-for-word translation produced in step #3,
into a gramatically correct sentence. See the introduction to the
FLAG_PASS section for details.
