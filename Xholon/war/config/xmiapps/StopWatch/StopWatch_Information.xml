Title: Stop Watch.
Comment:
&lt;p&gt;This very simple model of a stop watch is based on a Apache Software Foundation, Commons SCXML project at: http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/scxml/usecases/scxml-stopwatch.html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent of this Xholon application is to demonstrate an initial level of compatibility between UML, Xholon and SCXML. This sample application builds a simple model using a UML tool (MagicDraw 11.5), transforms it to Xholon format using XSLT scripts, executes it with the Xholon runtime framework, exports it to Scxml format from the Xholon GUI, and executes the exported file using the Commons SCXML software. A future version of Xholon will include more extensive support for the SCXML format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executing Xholon application will log the following output:&lt;/p&gt;
Stop_Watch:state_4 activeSubState is ready:state_6
stateMachine_2 activeSubState is Stop_Watch:state_4

Testing the Stop Watch state machine ...
Stop_Watch:state_4 activeSubState is running:state_7
stateMachine_2 activeSubState is Stop_Watch:state_4

Stop_Watch:state_4 activeSubState is paused:state_9
stateMachine_2 activeSubState is Stop_Watch:state_4

Stop_Watch:state_4 activeSubState is stopped:state_8
stateMachine_2 activeSubState is Stop_Watch:state_4

stateMachine_2 activeSubState is Stop_Watch:state_4

Stop_Watch:state_4 activeSubState is ready:state_6
stateMachine_2 activeSubState is Stop_Watch:state_4

&lt;p&gt;The Interaction file will contain content similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
