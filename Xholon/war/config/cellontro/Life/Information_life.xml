<section id="whatisit">
<title>What is it</title>
<p>This is a model of various biological systems, from individual cells, to organisms, to an entire ecosystem.
It's purpose is to explore how Xholon can be used to model a large system,
in this case a set of nested biological systems.</p>
<p>The model includes a Sun to provide light and energy, and an ecology in which various organisms can interact.
The ecology includes a lettuce plant and a human being. The lettuce photosynthesizes the light,
and sometimes reflects it to the eye of the human. The lettuce also absorbs water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients
from its environment (a lake, an atmosphere, and some soil). The human can see the lettuce, and through a
nervous system can move its mouth to eat some of the lettuce. The digestive system then converts nutrients
in the lettuce into a more usable form. The circulatory system circulates blood, that transports nutrients
between different parts of the body.</p>
<p>There's a lot happening in this simulation, so you'll need to take some time to explore it.</p>

<title>How to use it</title>
<section>
<title/>
<p>Run it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the Java application through the Xholon GUI (org.primordion.xholon.app.Xhn.java),
and select File --> Open --> cellontro --> Life --> Life_xhn.xml.</li>
<li>Expand the Controller node in the tree.</li>
<li>Press the Start node.</li>
<li>You should initially see a list of the parameters used in the model, displayed in the console window.
Each time step, various objects in the simulation will display information about themselves, for example:</li>

<title>Extending the model</title>
<p>The model could be extended by adding additional detail to any of the subsystems already in it.
The challenge with this model is to keep adding detail, while still allowing everything that's already there
to continue working. This is the goal of Xholon itself.</p>

<section id="xholonfeatures">
<title>Xholon and Ealontro features</title>
<p>A version of the model, Life_StaticFactory_xhn.xml, uses a static factory rather than the usual dynamic factory,
to create xholon instances at runtime.</p>
