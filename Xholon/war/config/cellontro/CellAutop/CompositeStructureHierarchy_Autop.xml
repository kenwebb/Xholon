		Initial Quantities
		==================
This describes how the pheneVal quantities were determined.
There are some inconsistencies in these calculations, which is OK for now.
Assume:
	a 100 by 100 grid. This is a space containing 10000 locations.
	that the membrane is in a diamond shape, and divides the space in half.
Therefore:
	half the locations are outside the membrane.           5000
	the membrane itself consists of 100 + 100 spaces.       200
	the remaining spaces are inside the membrane           4800

	Total:                                                10000
