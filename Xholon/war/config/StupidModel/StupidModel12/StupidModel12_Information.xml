<title>Xholon - Stupid Model 12 - Bug Mortality and Reproduction</title>
</header>
<body>

<section id="whatisit">
<title>What is it</title>
<p>This is the 12th in a series of 16 "Stupid Models". It's intended as a starting point for learning how to develop grid and agent-based models using Xholon. It can also be used to compare Xholon with other agent-based modeling tools that have also implemented the Stupid Model series.</p>
<p>In this model, bugs can die and reproduce. When a bug reaches a size of 10.0, it produces 5 offspring and then dies. Each new bug has an initial size of 0.0, and is randomly placed within 3 spaces of where its parent was. Each time step there is a 5% probability that each bug will die (95% survival probablity), but this is only determined after it has moved and grown. The model now stops after 1000 time steps or when there are no more bugs.</p>
