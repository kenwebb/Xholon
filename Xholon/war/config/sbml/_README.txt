All files in this directory should be files that were
automatically generated from SBML models. There should
be matched sets of four files. Use Sbml2Cellontro
to transform SBML files into Cellontro applications.

Example of a matched set of generated files:
    Glycolysis_xhn.xml
    Glycolysis_InheritanceHierarchy.xml
    Glycolysis_CompositeStructureHierarchy.xml
    Glycolysis_ClassDetails.xml
