The folders and files in this folder, are those in config/_common that are not in org.client.RCConfig.java .

The _module/QuantityIh.xml file is here so it can easily be replaced on the server without having
to recompile the Xholon library. QuanityIh.xml can optionally include a lot of other .xml
content, making available a large number of additional XholonClasses.

The user folder contains some optional XholonClasses that can be used in cellontro apps.
