    <h3>Xholon Graphics</h3>
    <p>Xholon focuses on inner structures. Many Xholon apps also include some graphics.
    This page links to some apps where graphics are especially important.
    The HTML5 technologies used on these pages includes
    Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Canvas, and WebGL.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=Cell&gui=none">Cell Metabolism</a> app includes an SVG block diagram that was automatically generated from the app using GraphViz. You can click and right-click on each object to learn more about it. When the app finishes, it displays an SVG-based line graph.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=Life&gui=d3cp">Life - cells, organism, ecology</a> app is a complex biology simulation with 20,000+ nodes. The page displays a single SVG image that includes all nodes. It use D3 Circle Packing. Hover above a node to see its full name, and to highlight which other nodes it references and which nodes reference it. Right-click a node to learn more about it. Nodes are nested up to 25 levels deep. Right-click a container node and select Export &gt; d3 &gt; CirclePack to see more detail.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=GameOfLife_Big&gui=none">Conway's Game of Life</a> app uses the HTML5 canvas to display an evolving cellular automaton in a 100 x 100 grid.</p>
    
    <p>The simple <a href="Xholon.html?app=HelloWorld_TestTime&gui=none">Hello World (with timeouts)</a> app displays itself as an SVG image. The clickable Hello and World nodes change size slightly every time step or every second time step.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=model04&gui=none">energy balance</a> model uses a Wikipedia SVG image. As the app runs it updates the numeric values in the image.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=carboncycle03&gui=none">carbon cycle</a> app uses another Wikipedia SVG image. It also updates the numeric values in the image as the app runs.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=f361d210093d4a5943d9&src=gist&gui=none">Black Geese</a> app displays a sequence of SVG-based D3 Circle Packing diagrams as the children's story evolves.</p>
    
    <p><a href="Xholon.html?app=fa997af189e6e9c343fe&src=gist&gui=none">Danny and the Dinosaur</a> is another children's story.</p>
    
    <p>A <a href="Xholon.html?app=ca00b929901de66fc721&src=gist&gui=none">day in the life</a> of a preschooler, presented as an animated children's story. There's a different routine each day of the week.</p>
    
    <p><a href="Xholon.html?app=8c88612f5c7b9ec9af80&src=gist&gui=none">Harold and the Purple Crayon</a> is another children's story.</p>
    
    <p><a href="Xholon.html?app=04bef197a0cc61a5a31d&src=gist&gui=none">The Tale of Peter Rabbit</a> is another children's story.</p>
    
    <p>And of course there's <a href="Xholon.html?app=f1cbb16e2ba269233c47&src=gist&gui=none">Cinderella</a>. This is a very simple version for young children.</p>
    
    <p>You can <a href="Xholon.html?app=c455c95cc513e7f88cb1&src=gist&gui=none">build your own story</a> using the <a href="http://www.primordion.com/Xholon/gwt/wb/editwb.html?app=c455c95cc513e7f88cb1&src=gist">story template</a>.</p>
    
    <p>This is a first test of <a href="XholonInteract.html?app=6901ef51d5fcb2d86a21&src=gist&gui=none">moving nodes around</a> on the graphic, using a mouse with interact.js .</p>
    
    <p>IcoMoon makes it easy to build symbol fonts. Some early experiments are <a href="Xholon.html?app=a26813678cd0090a800e&src=gist&gui=none">here</a>, <a href="Xholon.html?app=5199907b899fecbed583&src=gist&gui=none">here</a>, and <a href="Xholon.html?app=46cabf3ff05faa32e41e&src=gist&gui=none">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=Bestiary&gui=none">Bestiary</a> app features an open-ended dynamic environment with cats, humans, zombie's and more. Creatures move around on a HTML5 canavs and interact when they meet. Users can add new types of creatures, new behaviors, new houses and other artifacts, and so forth, while the app is running.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=TurtleExample1&gui=none">Turtle</a> examples app demonstrates NetLogo-like Turtle Graphics on a large grid.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=MeTTTa&gui=none&hide=xhtabs">MeTTTa</a> app is a simple game of tic tac toe, played on an HTML table.</p>
    
    <p>In the <a href="Xholon.html?app=Hex&gui=none">Hexagonal grid</a> app, creatures move through a random maze, laid out on an HTML5 canvas. Users can add a Monster that gradually converts other creatures into monsters, as they all move around the maze.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="Xholon.html?app=_09SpatialGames&gui=none">Spatial Games</a> app is an example from the book 'Evolutionary Dynamics', laid out on a rectangular grid. Colorful shapes continuously evolve into each other.</p>
